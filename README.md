--------------This is One-Page-Pitch--------------
Hong Kong is a business capital in Asia. According to that we believe a lot of people try to make a company or try to run own business in Hong Kong.

But not everyone has enough fund to run own business in the beginning. Hong Kong also is a city got a lot of people who want to earn more money by investing.

Our website is providing "Forum System" to match people who want to find someone for purpose. Our Target is the person who has skills or idea, want to run a business and want to get a investement or find a business partner to run the company together, then they can post their description to understand what they can do, what they want for their business. So Investors can see the post from our website and then if they have interest in one of them, and they would like to contact with them, we can provide a chatting system to talk to the person they like.
